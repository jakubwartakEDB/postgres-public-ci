 * Wait Events - Extension, InjectionPoint
 *
 * Use InjectionPoint when the server process is waiting in an injection
 * point.  Use Extension for other cases of the server process waiting for
 * some condition defined by an extension module.
 *
 * Extensions can define their own wait events in these categories.  They
 * should call one of these functions with a wait event string.  If the wait
 * event associated to a string is already allocated, it returns the wait
 * event information to use.  If not, it gets one wait event ID allocated from
 * a shared counter, associates the string to the ID in the shared dynamic
 * hash and returns the wait event information.
 *
 * The ID retrieved can be used with pgstat_report_wait_start() or equivalent.

 * pgstat_report_wait_start() -
 *
 *	Called from places where server process needs to wait.  This is called
 *	to report wait event information.  The wait information is stored
 *	as 8-bytes where:
 *	- first byte represents the wait event class (type of wait, for different
 *	  types of wait, refer WaitClass)
 *	- the next 3-bytes represent the actual wait event. Out of which:
 *	-- currently 2-bytes are used for wait event which is sufficient for
 *	   current usage,
 *	-- 1-byte is reserved for future usage.
 *	- the remaining 4-bytes are used to store additional per wait-event
 *	  details
 *
 *	Historically we used to make this reporting conditional on
 *	pgstat_track_activities, but the check for that seems to add more cost
 *	than it saves.
 *
 *	my_wait_event_info initially points to local memory, making it safe to
 *	call this before MyProc has been initialized.
